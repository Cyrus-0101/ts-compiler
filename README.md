# TS-Compiler

> Have you ever thought of building your own Compiler, well here's this gunk.

This repo contains **TS-Compiler**, a handwritten, `well keyboard written but let's be fancy` compiler in TS Node.
It illustrates basic concepts of compiler construction and how one can tool the language inside of an
IDE by exposing APIs for parsing and type checking. We will write tests and try to have 80% code coverage.

This compiler uses many of the concepts that you can find in the Microsoft C# and Visual Basic compilers, code named [Roslyn].
It's quite literally almost a low-level duplicate.

## TO-DO:
[] Work on launch.json to understand why its not opening an external terminal for my terminal applications.
